# Project Background
One of my modules for Year 2 is **Software Engineering Practice (aka SEP)** where I had to **document an IT project life cycle using the SCRUM process, artefacts and diagrams over 1 month** based on a given problem statement...

## Problem Statement
In a group of 3, we were to simulate the real life project life cycle of **IslandFurniture web portal system** from user requirement gathering to user requirement documentation.

### Other Notes

1. This project has **no association to IslandFurniture in real life**.
